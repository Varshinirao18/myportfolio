    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Nagavaram Sri Varshini, a passionate Data Science student with hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Python programming.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a highly motivated Data Science student eager to apply my skills in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Python to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about working with real-world datasets, uncovering hidden insights, and building effective predictive models. I am currently focused on expanding my skillset in SQL and data visualization techniques to enhance my ability to communicate data-driven stories. I am a quick learner and enjoy collaborating with others to achieve common goals.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Cyber Abuse Recognition System using BERT</h3>
            <p>This project aimed to build a system for automatically detecting cyber abuse in online text. I leveraged the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for natural language processing. I fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of labeled text data (abusive vs. non-abusive). I experimented with different fine-tuning strategies and evaluated the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. I achieved [mention your accuracy or F1-score] on the test set. I also explored techniques for explainability to understand which words or phrases were most influential in the model's predictions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prediction of Loan Approval System</h3>
            <p>This project focused on predicting loan approval based on applicant data. I used a dataset containing information about loan applicants (e.g., credit score, income, loan amount). I explored several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. I used scikit-learn in Python for model training and evaluation. I performed feature engineering to improve model performance and used cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness. I compared the performance of the different models and selected the best performing one based on [mention the metric you used, e.g., AUC, accuracy]. The final model achieved [mention your accuracy or other metric] on the test data.</p>
